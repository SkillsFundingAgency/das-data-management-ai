## üöÄ Infrastucture Deployment 

```
The Azure infrastructure for this project requires some additional manual steps to complete the setup. The steps to complete a full deployment are as follows:

1. Deploy the Infrastructure using [![Azure DevOps]](https://dev.azure.com/sfa-gov-uk/Digital%20Apprenticeship%20Service/_build/latest?definitionId=2651&repoName=SkillsFundingAgency%2Fdas-data-management-ai&branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/sfa-gov-uk/Digital%20Apprenticeship%20Service/_build?definitionId=2651&_a=summary)
2. Grant the ML and ML CPU Cluster read/write access to the Data Management database
    ```CREATE USER [cluster-resource-name] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER```
    ```ALTER ROLE [ml-role] ADD member [cluster-resource-name]```
    ```CREATE USER [workspace-resource-name] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER```
    ```ALTER ROLE [ml-role] ADD member [workspace-resource-name]```
3. IAM
    - The Storage Account IAM is actions by the running the Set-MLResourcePermissions.ps1 script in the Azure folder. See script for example.
    - This should be replaced with a more automated solution when a design has been accepted for automating permission changes.
4. Manually add the SQL DataStore to the ML Portal with the following details. This should be added to the template in time
    - Datastore name : datamgmtdb
    - Datastore type : Azure SQL Database
    - Server name : <SQL Server Name>
    - Database : <Data Management Database Name>
    - Save credentials with datastore for data access : No
```

## üêõ Known Issues

There is discussion ongoing about the CI design for deploying infrastructure and running models. Currently the automatic run is disabled because of data issues but the Platform Team advise this is not a suitable solution because it masks issues behind 'fake' successfull deployments. 

The WoW of the data team whereby branches are used to trigger runs and deployed up the environment stack causes problems working between teams and ensuring test data is available.
